# VSCode Development Container

The development containers provided by Microsoft are typically too focussed (not enough is installed). This container image includes a full suite of development tools. The idea is to build once and use it everywhere.

Use a Docker Compose file to easily add dependant services (e.g. PostgreSQL).
