# VSCode Development Container

This container is my personal, opinionated, alternative to development containers provided by Microsoft. Those containers are either too light (not enough is installed) or too bloated (to much is installed).

Using a Docker Compose file allows to easily add dependant services (e.g. PostgreSQL).
